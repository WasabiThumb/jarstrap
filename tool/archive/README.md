The archive to be included in the program by CMake
is stored in this directory. ``sample.jar`` is a lean
Java 5+ executable that simply prints the version
of Java that was loaded from within the environment.
``archive.jar`` (if present) is the JAR file set by
``build.py`` (or manually) for CMake to use.
